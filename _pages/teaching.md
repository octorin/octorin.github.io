I have successfully taught a Marketing Core (<i>Marketing Management</i>) as a sole instructor for a full semester, earning high ratings and positive comments (see Teaching details below). I will  have taught the same course for another full semester by the time I graduate. I employ a variety of instructional methods including business cases, audiovisuals, guest speakers, interactive discussions, and team projects, to create a course experience that is relevant, evidence-based, and personalized, to enable students to see how marketing concepts apply to both real business situations and personal decisions.

I am deeply passionate about and committed to my role as an educator. I am interested in and ready to teach courses in marketing management, consumer behavior, social and digital marketing, brand management, and managerial decision making at all levels.

        “This class was a highlight of my time at Cornell”<br><br>
        “The class was super fun and Rin always made sure to go the extra mile to help us understand the course material and engage with real world marketing problems.”<br><br>
“I have had the privilege of taking Rin’s NCC 5530, which has been instrumental in shaping my understanding not only of marketing-related knowledge but also of what it is like to be a good educator. I am really inspired by her teaching style and surprised by the impact she has made.”<br><br>
“I love her class so much and her class made me find out what I am passionate about. I just found a marketing intern job for this summer and will apply the knowledge she taught us this semester to reality.”<br><br>
“She is so enthusiastic about teaching and guiding us to participate in class, as well as learn the material. I am always excited about her class, and all material can be applied to the assignments and projects. To be honest I hope she can teach more classes.”</i></span></div></li>
