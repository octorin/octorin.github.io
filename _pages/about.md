Welcome! I am an incoming Assistant Professor of Marketing at the University of Iowa, Tippie College of Business. I am currently finishing my PhD in Marketing at the [SC Johnson Graduate School of Management](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/programs/phd-program/current-students/yy878/) at Cornell University.
<br><br>
I study consumer psychology at the moment of transaction to help organizations design incentives and payment environments that are more effective. My research has appeared in <i>Psychological Science</i> and the <i>Cornell Hospitality Quarterly</i>.

    <summary>More about me?</summary>
Before joining academia, I worked in consulting at Pfizer and Hyundai Motor Company HQs. I have also hosted and produced a local <a href="https://archive.org/embed/kerouac_201704?start=1307" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">radio show</a> in Korea (which flew far under the radar), where I had a blast monologuing on my favorite topics, such as behavioral economics, social psychology, and experimental philosophy.<br><br>
  
I earned a bachelor's degree in Communication Studies with a minor in Statistics from UCLA, graduating with college and departmental honors. I also received a master's degree in Marketing from Korea University Business School, graduating with the highest distinction.
