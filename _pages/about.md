I am doing my Marketing PhD at [Johnson Graduate School of Management](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University. I specialize in consumer behavior and have a keen interest in studying how even the smallest payments that we receive, whether from vendors, organizations, or family, influence and shape consumer behavior. My current projects examine various factors that shape consumers' psychology of getting paid and their consequences. 

Before joining Cornell, I worked for Pfizer and Hyundai Motor Company HQs, and happily hosted a geeky local NPR [show](https://jtr.mystrikingly.com/) on sciences and philosophy just south of Seoul. I received my bacherlor's degree with honors in Communication Studies and Statistics from UCLA, and my Master's degree with the award of excellence in Marketing from Korea University Busincess School.

I will be on next year's job market, 2024-25.
