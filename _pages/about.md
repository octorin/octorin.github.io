I am a Ph.D. student in [xxxx](https://sociology.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University. I work on topics in incentivization, social networks, social mobility, and quantitative and computational methods.
Prior to joining Cornell, I worked for companies including Pfizer and Hyundai Motor Company, and hosted a Korean public radio show on behavioral science. I received my degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles (B.A. in Communication Studies with honors) and Korea University (M.S. in Marketing with the academic award of excellence).

My current projects examine examine how various factors shape consumers' psychology of getting paid to eventually shape behavior. I will be on the 2024-2025 job market.
