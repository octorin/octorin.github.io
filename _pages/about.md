Welcome! I’m an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the Tippie College of Business, University of Iowa.
<br><br>
I study how people think and feel at the moment of transaction, and how we can design payment and incentive systems that work better for people and for society.
<br><br>
This work has been recognized with an Honorable Mention for the 2025 John A. Howard/AMA Doctoral Dissertation Award and the ACR’s Best Paper Award (2025).
<br><br>
I earned a Ph.D. in Marketing from the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University, in Ithaca, NY—a town I wrote a short ode to in my <a class="page-link" href="{{ '/acknowledgments/' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">dissertation acknowledgments</a>. I also hold a bachelor's degree with college and departmental honors in Communication Studies with a minor in Statistics from UCLA, and a master's degree in Marketing from Korea University Business School.
