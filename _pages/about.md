Welcome! I’m an incoming Assistant Professor of Marketing at the Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa.
<br><br>
My main research interest is in studying consumer psychology at the moment of transaction, and in helping organizations design more effective incentives and payment environments.
<br><br>
I hold a Ph.D. in Marketing from the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University, in Ithaca, NY—a town I wrote a short ode to in my <a class="page-link" href="{{ 'acknowledgments' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">dissertation acknowledgments</a>. I also hold a B.A. in Communications, with a minor in Statistics, from UCLA, and an M.S. in Marketing from Korea University Business School.

    <summary>More about me?</summary>
Before entering academia, I worked in consulting with clients including Pfizer and Hyundai Motor Company HQs. I also hosted and produced a local radio show in Korea (which flew far under the radar), where I monologued on behavioral science, odd science and tech news, <a href="https://archive.org/embed/kerouac_201704?start=1307" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Korean poetry</a>, and experimental philosophy.</details> <br>
