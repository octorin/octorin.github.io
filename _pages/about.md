Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Marketing at [Johnson Graduate School of Management](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/programs/phd-program/current-students/yy878/) at Cornell University, specializing in Consumer Behavior. My research explores how receiving payments or benefits influences consumer perceptions and decision-making. Specifically, my dissertation looks into how even the slightest benefits offered by vendors, charitable organizations, and hotels influence and shape consumer judgments and decisions, especially in an online setting.

    <summary>More about me?</summary>
Before joining Cornell, I worked for Pfizer and Hyundai Motor Company HQs on a variety of management consulting projects. I have also hosted a local NPR show in Korea (which flew far under the radar), where I had a blast monologuing on my favorite topics including, but not limited to, behavioral science and philosophy. I received my bachelor's degree with honors in Communication Studies and a minor in Statistics from UCLA, and my Master's degree in Marketing with the award of excellence from Korea University Business School.

I will be on this year's job market, 2024-25. You can view my CV <a href="http://rinyoon.com/assets/pdf/Yoon_CV.pdf">here</a>.
