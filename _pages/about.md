Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Marketing at the [SC Johnson Graduate School of Management](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/programs/phd-program/current-students/yy878/) at Cornell University, specializing in Consumer Behavior. My research focuses on consumer psychology at the moment of transaction to help organizations design incentives and payment environments that are more effective. My research has appeared in <i>Psychological Science</i> and the <i>Cornell Hospitality Quarterly</i>.

    <summary>More about me?</summary>
Before Ph.D., I worked for Pfizer and Hyundai Motor Company HQs on a variety of consulting projects. I have also produced and hosted a local radio show in Korea (which flew far under the radar), where I had a blast monologuing on my favorite topics, such as behavioral science, social psychology, and philosophy. I received my B.A. in Communication Studies from UCLA, graduating with college and departmental honors, and my M.S. in Marketing from Korea University Business School, graduating with the Award of Academic Excellence.
