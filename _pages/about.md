Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Marketing at [SC Johnson Graduate School of Management](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/programs/phd-program/current-students/yy878/) at Cornell University, specializing in Consumer Behavior. I study what happens in consumer psychology at the moment of payment to identify more effective ways to provide incentives and design payment environments for consumers. Specifically, my dissertation examines how even the slightest consumer benefits offered at the moment of payment by vendors, charitable organizations, and hotels shape consumers' decision-making and behavior, particularly in online settings. My research has been published in <i>Psychological Science</i>.

    <summary>More about me?</summary>
Before my Ph.D., I worked for Pfizer and Hyundai Motor Company HQs on a variety of management consulting projects. I have also produced and hosted a radio show in Korea (which flew far under the radar), where I had a blast monologuing on my favorite topics, such as behavioral science, social psychology, and philosophy. I received my B.A. in Communication Studies from UCLA, and my M.S. in Marketing from Korea University.
