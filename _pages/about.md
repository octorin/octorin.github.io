Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Marketing at [Johnson Graduate School of Management](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/programs/phd-program/current-students/yy878/) at Cornell University, specializing in Consumer Behavior. My research explores how receiving payments or benefits influences consumer perceptions and decision-making processes. My dissertation explores how even the slightest benefits offered by vendors, charitable organizations, and hotels influence and shape consumer judgments and decisions, especially in an online setting.

    <summary>More about me?</summary>
Before joining Cornell, I worked for Pfizer and Hyundai Motor Company HQs on a variety of management consulting projects. I have also hosted a <a href="https://jtr.strikingly.com">local NPR show in South Korea</a> (which flew very much under the radar), where I had a blast mostly monologuing on my favorite topics including, but not limited to, behavioral sciences and philosophy. I received my bachelor's degree with honors in Communication Studies and Statistics from UCLA, and my Master's degree with the award of excellence in Marketing from Korea University Busincess School.

I will be on next year's job market, 2024-25.
