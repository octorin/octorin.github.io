I am doing my Marketing PhD at [Johnson Graduate School of Management](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University. I specialize in consumer behavior and have a keen interest in studying how even the smallest payments that we receive, whether from vendors, organizations, or family, influence and shape consumer behavior. My current projects examine various factors that shape consumers' psychology of getting paid and their consequences. 

Before joining Cornell, I worked for Pfizer and Hyundai Motor Company HQs, and happily hosted a geeky local NPR [show]((https://jtr.mystrikingly.com/) on sciences and philosophy just south of Seoul. I received my bacherlor's degree from UCLA (Communication and Statistics, graduated with college and departmental honors), and my Master's in Marketing from Korea University Busincess School (graduated with distiction).

I will be on next year's job market, 2024-25.
