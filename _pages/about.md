Welcome! I am an incoming Assistant Professor of Marketing at the University of Iowa, Tippie College of Business. I am currently finishing my PhD in Marketing at the [SC Johnson Graduate School of Management](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/programs/phd-program/current-students/yy878/) at Cornell University. My research focuses on consumer psychology at the moment of transaction to help organizations design incentives and payment environments that are more effective. My research has appeared in <i>Psychological Science</i> and the <i>Cornell Hospitality Quarterly</i>.

    <summary>More about me?</summary>
Before joining academia, I worked for Pfizer and Hyundai Motor Company HQs on various consulting projects. I have also hosted and produced a local radio show in Korea (which flew far under the radar), where I had a blast monologuing on my favorite topics, such as behavioral science, social psychology, and philosophy.<br><br>
  
I earned a bachelor's degree with college and departmental honors in Communication Studies from UCLA, and a master's in Marketing from Korea University Business School, graduating with The Award of Academic Excellence.
