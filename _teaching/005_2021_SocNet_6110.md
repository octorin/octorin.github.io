title: Social Networks
description: Introduction into Social Networks
year: 2021
---

This is *not* a so-called "methods course." Rather, students read through a series of papers that discuss topics in the sociological literature of networks and interactions. However, since the field of social networks developed simultaneously as a theoretical as well as methodological framework, some methodological and mathematical issues are covered.

All notes below are intended to help students with their understanding of these technical issues. But, except for the note on random walks, they are optional material for the curious students, rather than being required. Pointing out any typos or errors in these materials is greatly appreciated.
